Driver drowsiness is a critical factor contributing to road accidents worldwide. To address this issue, a driver
drowsiness system has been developed using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system uses
various sensors and algorithms to monitor the driver's behavior and physiological signals, such as eye and mouth
movement. The system aims to detect signs of drowsiness, such as yawning, and provide timely warnings to the
driver, preventing potential accidents. The driver drowsiness system utilizes a combination of hardware and
software components. A camera is employed to capture the driver's facial expressions and eye movements in realtime. Computer vision algorithms analyze the captured images to identify specific indicators of drowsiness,
including yawning. The effectiveness of the driver drowsiness system has been evaluated through extensive
testing and performance analysis. The system demonstrates high accuracy in detecting drowsiness and providing
timely warnings, thereby mitigating the risks associated with drowsy driving. In this system, weâ€™re using eye
landmarks which determine the EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio ratio) to check whether the driver is drowsy.
